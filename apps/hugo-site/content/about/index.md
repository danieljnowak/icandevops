🌍 Tech, Travel, and the Search for What’s Beautiful
Hey, I’m Daniel Nowak—a DevOps Engineer by trade, a traveler by heart, and someone who’s always on the lookout for the things that make the world beautiful.

💻 The Tech Side of Me
Some people see tech as just code and servers. I see it as magic—the kind you can build, automate, and scale. Whether it’s launching cloud infrastructure with Terraform, making deployments seamless with CI/CD pipelines, or optimizing AWS environments, I love the challenge of taking something complex and making it smooth, fast, and effortless.

But let’s be real—tech isn’t just about the tools. It’s about the people you build with. The best engineering happens when ideas flow, teams click, and everyone gets to bring their best to the table.

✈️ The Travel Side of Me
If I’m not deep in automation workflows, you might find me wandering through a new city, chasing sunsets, or trying street food in some corner of the world.

I love exploring, getting lost, and seeing life from new perspectives. Whether it's discovering a hidden café in a foreign city or watching the Northern Lights dance across the sky, I believe the world is full of small, breathtaking moments—if you take the time to look.

Honestly, tech and travel aren’t that different—both are about curiosity, problem-solving, and stepping into the unknown.

👨‍💼 My Take on Leadership
I think leadership is kind of like being a great dungeon master—you don’t play the game for your team, but you set them up for the best possible adventure.

For me, leadership isn’t about titles or control—it’s about empowering people to win. That means:

* Creating an environment where ideas can thrive 🧠
* Giving people autonomy to do their best work 🚀
* Clearing roadblocks instead of creating them 🏗️
* Leading with humor, humility, and trust 🎭

At the end of the day, a great leader makes the team feel unstoppable.

🚀 Let’s Build Something Cool
I’m always down to chat about DevOps, AWS, automation, or where to find the best tacos in any given city.

Find me on GitHub, or let’s grab a drink and talk about the next big adventure. 🎉
